    abstract = { Although mixed precision arithmetic has recently garnered interest for training dense neural networks, many other applications could benefit from the speedups and lower storage cost if applied appropriately. The growing interest in employing mixed precision computations motivates the need for rounding error analysis that properly handles behavior from mixed precision arithmetic. We develop mixed precision variants of existing Householder QR algorithms and show error analyses supported by numerical experiments. }

@article{BISCHOFC1987TWrf,
abstract = {A new way to represent products of Householder matrices is given that makes a typical Householder matrix algorithm rich in matrix-matrix multiplication. This is very desirable in that matrix-matrix multiplication is the operation of choice for an increasing number of important high performance computers. We tested the new representation by using it to compute the QR factorization on the FPS-164/MAX. Preliminary results indicate that it is a very efficient way to organize Householder computations.},
